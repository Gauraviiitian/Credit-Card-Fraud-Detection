# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection---Machine-Learning-Project
Nowadays Credit Cards are very common everywhere, so it is today's need to make it safe and secure. This project predicts the fraudulent transaction using Anomaly Detection.
Relevant Dataset can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud.
I have taken guidance from a tutorial to accomplish this project. At this point of time the accuracy of Isolation Forest Algorithm is just 30%. I will be trying to optimize it using other algorithms also. I have used two algorithms till now IsolationForest and LocalOutlierFactor, in which IsolationForest gives somewhat better results.
